# Readme
This repo is a demonstration of material classification based on an oscillator model of atoms. We reproduce some of the results from the 2015 work of Friedrich Hensel, Daniel R. Slocombe and Peter P. Edwards [doi](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2014.0477).

Atomic polarizability values are taken from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 85th edition Chapter 10 page 168.
Molar volumes are taken from Mathematica's ElementData function via [periodictable.com](https://periodictable.com/Properties/A/MolarVolume.an.log.html).
Elemental conductivity values are from the same source.
